The program consists of two classes - Fraction and FractionHeir. Fraction implements arithmetic with fractional numbers. The main function provides an example of using the class.
FractionHeir does the same thing, but with a saturation check. Saturation is considered to be the result exceeding the set value (in this case 10000). 
A * sign is placed next to such a number and any other derived from this number.
// GCD method - finds the largest common divisor.
